Response time: 5.113575548999961

Question nr: 67
Correct answer: D
Model's answer: Since no relationships were found, it's reasonable to assume that both entities are independent. In this case, the probability of neither winning is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each entity not winning.

Let's assume the probability of one entity not winning is p1, and the probability of the other entity not winning is p2. Then, the probability of neither of them winning would be:

p1 * p2

Since we don't have any specific information about these entities or their relationships, it's difficult to provide a precise value for this probability. However, in general, when two events are independent, the probability of both not occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

So, without further information, I would say that the likelihood of neither of them winning is p1 * p2.
